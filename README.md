# 🤖 Agentic AI Playground

Welcome to my personal learning sandbox for **Agentic AI**. This repository documents my journey moving beyond simple LLM API calls to building robust, stateful, and autonomous systems.

## 🚀 About This Project

I started this project to "level up" from standard Gemini/OpenAI API integrations. Here, I explore the orchestration of complex workflows, cyclic graphs, and autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and debug themselves.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **LangChain**: For composable and robust LLM application logic.
*   **LangGraph**: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with cyclic graph structures.
*   **LangSmith**: For tracing, monitoring, and evaluating LLM performance.
*   **Gemini / OpenAI**: The underlying intelligence models.

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   `LangGraph/`: Experiments with cyclic agentic workflows, state management, and tool use.
*   `Langsmith/`: Implementation of RAG pipelines, tracing, and evaluation metrics.
*   `git_automated_push.py`: Utility script for automating rapid git contributions.
*   `complex_agent_workflow.mmd`: Visual diagrams of the agent systems designed here.

## 📝 Learning Resources & Notes

I am maintaining detailed notes on concepts, architecture patterns, and lessons learned during this course. You can find the full documentation here:

## 🌟 Goals

*   Build autonomous agents that can handle multi-step reasoning.
*   Master the art of "Flow Engineering" over "Prompt Engineering".
*   Prepare for upcoming hackathons with a library of reusable agent patterns.
